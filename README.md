# even-odd

Write a Python program that reads a text file named numbers.txt that contains 20 integers. The program will create two other text file; the first text file will be named even.txt that will contains all even numbers extracted from the numbers.txt. The second text file will be named odd.txt that will contains all odd numbers extracted from the numbers.txt.

Process:
1. You must create a txt file called numbers.txt where you will enter 20   integers.
2. Also, create two other files where it will write the numbers; even.txt if the integers are even, and odd.txt if the integers are odd.
3. Read the integers that is on numbers.txt.
4. Write an if-else statement wherein if the integer is even, it will go to even.txt and if the integers are odd, it will go to odd txt.
5. Run the program

If you run the program, the odd and even integers will be seperated into their respective files.
